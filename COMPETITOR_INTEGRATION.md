### **Database Storage:**

Both insights and competitor analysis are automatically saved to your MySQL database:

- **`store`** table: Regular insights data
- **`competitor_analysis`** table: Competitor analysis results

### **Key Features:**

1. **Smart Caching**: Checks for existing competitor analysis before running new analysis
2. **Error Handling**: Graceful fallback if competitor analysis fails
3. **Shopify Detection**: Only analyzes competitors that use Shopify
4. **Complete Integration**: Works with existing insights extraction
5. **Database Persistence**: All results stored for future retrieval

### **Usage Tips:**

- Use `include_competitor_analysis: false` for faster regular insights
- Use `include_competitor_analysis: true` for complete analysis
- Use `/comprehensive-analysis` for the most complete data
- Use stored analysis endpoints to retrieve previous results quickly

The competitor analysis is now fully integrated and will be included in your application responses based on the endpoint and parameters you choose!
